# Bengine
A javascript browser block engine.

Bengine handles the creating and deleting of "blocks", which are just html elements. You can create custom blocks with special javascript functionality and add them to Bengine. Those custom blocks are coded into contructor objects which are called "extensibles".

For a simple example of the block engine, visit [wisepool playground](http://wisepool.io/play).

## Wanted Extensibles

If you would like to contribute to this project, please consider coding the following wanted extensibles:

- CodeMirror block
